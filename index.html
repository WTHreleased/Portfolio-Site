          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            My love and proclivity for technology began as a child navigating
            DOS on my IBM 8088. Soon I was building computers for a neighbor in
            exchange for components I could use to upgrade or build my own
            computers. In school I was introduced to programming (Logo and
            Pascal).
          </p>
          <p>
            Regrettably, I didn't pursue development. Work, college, and life
            took over; and the extent of my programming was occassionally
            modifying Excel scripts in VBA. A recent experience building a
            website (BeyondLWOP.org) using WPBakery has reignited my passion to
            code. In spite of using a page builder, I was quite surprised by
            what I accomplished without formal web development training.
          </p>
          <p>
            25+ years later, I regret not pursuing it sooner. At age 47 with
            many responsibilities, I can't imagine this will ever become a
            career. Nonetheless, I am pursuing it for my own pleasure and
            well-being.
